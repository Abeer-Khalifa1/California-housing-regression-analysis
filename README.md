# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project that implements and compares various regression techniques to predict median house prices in California. This project demonstrates both a deep theoretical understanding by building models from scratch with NumPy and practical application using Scikit-Learn's optimized libraries.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Dual Implementation**: All models (Linear, Lasso, Ridge) are built both from scratch and using Scikit-Learn for a complete comparison.
- **Custom Gradient Descent**: A full implementation of gradient descent optimization with cost history tracking.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a held-out validation set.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes proper data splitting (70% train, 15% validation, 15% test) and feature scaling.
